cancle wf
rerun jobs
rerun failed jobs 
if multiple rerun happens
    those will be shown in attempts not in main workflow run section
we can check workflow files and usage in workflow runs

organization//settings/actions/hosted-runners -> 
    can monitor the currently running jobs


click on line number in debugging in workflow jobs , then copy the url and then
you can easily share the issue, we can dwnload log files also
show timestamp and delete log ...

at the time of rerun if we want by default the debug logs then 
    wf - settings - secrets and variables - variables - new repo variable 
        ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG // will add more logs in our job logs
        true

        ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG // will add more log files in the downloaded log archive 
        true

    same will work for secrets

    we can set the varible from vs code extension (github actions also)

// sometime need to skip the workflow running without disabling it
    commit message should contain
        [skip ci]
        [ci skip]
        [no ci]
        [skip actions]
        [actions skip]

// workflow commands for github actions
